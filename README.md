Here is the project description in point format:

- Imported and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets for effective model evaluation.
- Fitted a Linear Regression model using the `sklearn.linear_model` library on the training data.
- Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and coefficient of determination (RÂ²).
- Plotted the regression line alongside the data points.
- Interpreted the model coefficients to understand the relationship between independent variables and the target variable.
